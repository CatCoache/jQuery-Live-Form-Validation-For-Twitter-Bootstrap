----------------------------------
UPDATED 4/5/2012: Now works with Twitter Bootstrap 2 and its new control-group css class. 

Should still work with earlier versions of Bootstrap, as long as the error_container_class option parameter is passed in (default value is for Bootstrap v2). Other option is just to clone the revision 10f0dd18f0e648fa2e8a69256e4a850654d97a7b from Jan 22, 2012.
----------------------------------

This is an adaptation of the jQuery Live Form Validation found at http://www.geektantra.com/2009/09/jquery-live-form-validation/ for Twitter Bootstrap. The modified script will allow for live form validation using the Twitter Bootstrap HTML pattern for forms.

The main script is jquery.validate.js. This has a validate method that you can call on any jQuery input object.
For instructions please see the link above. The changes for Twitter Bootstrap are the names of couple of the parameters, and using a container div w/ class=validation-container instead of the input field to highlight a validation error.

The jquery.validation.functions.js file has not been modified in anyway and simply provides helper methods for date and radio button validation.
