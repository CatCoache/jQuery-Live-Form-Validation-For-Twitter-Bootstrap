This is an adaptation of the jQuery Live Form Validation found at http://www.geektantra.com/2009/09/jquery-live-form-validation/ for Twitter Bootstrap. The modified script will allow for live form validation using the Twitter Bootstrap HTML pattern for forms.

The main script is jquery.validate.js. This has a validate method that you can call on any jQuery input object.
For instructions please see the link above. The changes for Twitter Bootstrap are the names of couple of the parameters, and using a container div w/ class=validation-container instead of the input field to highlight a validation error.

The jquery.validation.functions.js file has not been modified in anyway and simply provides helper methods for date and radio button validation.
